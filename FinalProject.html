<div class="header">Florida's Not So Perfect Storm</div>

<div class="subtitle"> When a housing crisis and climate change collide. </div>

Earlier this year Hurricane Ian decimated a large portion of Florida’s population <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events">killing 131 people</a> and resulting in potential damage costs <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events">exceeding $50 billion</a>, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. Unfortunately, a severe storm comes as no surprise to the region as Florida’s risk for hurricanes has been well-known for years. As FEMA and other organizations step in to assist Floridians, it is clear to see people struggling to find housing. It is likely to see these issues worsen as the cost of living is rising and climate change experts expect hurricanes to become more severe. 
        <br><br>
Florida faces a challenging road ahead. Here we analyze the macro economic and environmental factors that contour the current housing crisis and environmental challenges the state has been experiencing and consider what Florida’s future will likely entail. 
        <br><br>
    <b>The Housing Crisis in Florida</b><br>
Cost of living has increased across the nation as inflation has reached the highest point we’ve seen in years, putting pressure on middle and lower class families. Typically in high inflationary environments, the government steps in to increase interest rates, which includes mortgage rates. 
        <br><br>
    At the beginning of 2022 mortgage rates were low across the United States. In fact, the average rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage in January was 3.45%. However, due to inflation, rates have increased a staggering amount and are currently sitting at 6.9%. This is the largest change in rates in the last 12 years:

        </div>
  
    <div class="body">   
This means people and families who have been saving for years to buy a home will be delayed even further as they cannot afford to make their purchase with such high rates.
        <br><br>
From an analysis conducted by Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, Florida’s median income has only increased 1.9% since 2017 while the price of housing sales and rent prices have increased 6.1% and 7.3%, respectively. 
        <br><br>    
According to the Washington Post, one family was originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/10/03/hurricane-ian-housing/">paying $1,200 for rent</a> and was on the hunt for a new place to live after Hurricane Ian. Comparable apartments are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/10/03/hurricane-ian-housing/">now renting for $2,000</a>. With increasing competition, prices will soar even for homes unaffected by Hurricane Ian. 
        <br><br>
The housing deficit is predominantly affecting the lower- and middle-classes as we are seeing a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/10/03/hurricane-ian-housing/">shortage of 500,000 homes</a> for these families across the state of Florida. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/floridians-displaced-by-hurricane-ian-face-decisions-on-how-or-if-they-will-rebuild">Thousands of Florida residents have applied for aid</a> and are in need of housing.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, property insurance firms are becoming insolvent because they can’t keep up with the volume of insurance claims in the wake of Hurricane Ian. The industry has taken a hard hit, with <a href="https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/receiver/companies">five insurance providers liquidated this year alone.</a>
        <br><br>
Another symptom of the growing affordability crisis in Florida is the increasing projected housing cost burden. Researchers from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_featd_article_092214.html">define</a> it as households where more than 30% of their income goes to rent. Nationwide in <a href="https://www.prb.org/articles/u-s-housing-cost-burden-declines-among-homeowners-but-remains-high-for-renters/">2019</a>, nearly half of renters and one-quarter of homeowners spent at least a third of their income on housing associated costs. The Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse <a href="http://flhousingdata.shimberg.ufl.edu/population-and-household-projections/results?nid=100000#household-projections-by-tenure-income-ami-and-cost-burden-2000-2040-detail">projects</a> that the problem will only get worse.
<br><br>
Much of this can be traced to one problem: the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wages-not-keeping-up-with-inflation/">inability</a> of wages to keep pace with the growing cost of living. This is largely due to the historic levels of inflation seen in 2022. Even though wages have grown, they have not grown quickly enough to make a meaningful difference to cover housing related costs. There are no signs of this trend reversing. The Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse projects that at best, this phenomenon will only slow down in the coming decades.

       <br> Against the backdrop of an already existing housing crisis, and with climate change knocking at the door, Hurricane Ian has put a pressure on Florida’s residents that won’t be lifting any time soon.

        <b>Florida's Hurricanes are Worsening</b><br>
        Climate scientists predict Florida hurricanes will continue to <a href="https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/environment/2022-10-19/florida-climate-scientist-hurricanes-intensifying-becoming-more-frequent">become more severe</a> and more frequent in the future. Of the hurricanes in Florida since 2000,<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101pINuItdeP_hH8FYhWPh8v1xGWBe5ku/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113841400294944273915&rtpof=true&sd=true">over 50% have occurred within the last 5 years.</a>
        <br><br>
        As climate change worsens, sea surface temperatures, like in the Gulf of Mexico, will continue to rise causing hurricanes to intensify. Higher surface temperatures encourage hurricanes to develop more rapidly meaning we will continue to see more and more category 4 and category 5 storms, just like Hurricane Ian in Florida. The warming of our oceans also expands the water and accelerates the melting of ice caps, all leading to sea level rise — another battle the coastal populations of Florida will continue to face. 
        <br><br>
        Research has also shown that hurricanes themselves will likely contribute to the worsening of climate change. Climate experts recently asserted that Hurricane Ian has caused a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-science-storms-climate-and-environment-hurricane-ian-80f57ce05ec99bae841e7b72e710cd13">10% increase in atmospheric moisture and rainfall.</a> One of these experts, Kerry Emanuel who is a hurricane researcher at MIT, says “This business above very very heavy rain is something we’ve expected to see because of climate change…We’ll see more storms like Ian.”
<br><br>
        <b>Florida is Becoming More Vulnerable </b>
        <br>
        Although we are seeing the worsening effects of climate change on a global scale, Florida is a particularly vulnerable population. According to a <a href="https://assets.firststreet.org/uploads/2020/06/first_street_foundation__first_national_flood_risk_assessment.pdf">report</a> released by the First Street Foundation in 2020, five counties in Florida are in the top 10 of the entire country with the highest flood risk. This map models the percent of properties in each county in Florida that are at risk of flooding in a 100-year event, according to First Streets 2020 data report. 

    </div>
    
    <div class="map">
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12104980"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    
    
<div class="body">   
        <br><br>
To make matters worse, flood risk is increasing in Florida. According to First Street’s report, 1,833,300 properties were at substantial risk of flooding in 2020. They projected that this number would rise 18.6% in the next three decades, leaving 2,174,400 properties at substantial risk. 
        <br><br>
Among all this, we have seen, and will continue to see, a significant increase in population in Florida, especially in the coastal areas that are at a much higher flood risk. This map shows how the population density of Florida has increased from 1960 to 2020. It also shows the projections of population density increase for 2040, as calculated by <a href="http://flhousingdata.shimberg.ufl.edu/population-and-household-projections/results?nid=100000">Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse.</a> It is obvious that inland populations of Florida have remained relatively low for the past 60 years while the coastal counties, that are at a much higher risk for flooding, are continuing to rapidly increase. <br><br>

     <div class="map">
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1769468"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="body">   
        With this rise of population in high risk areas, the potential damages and costs of these intensifying hurricanes will also increase. As Stephen Stader of Villanova University <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/briefing/why-hurricanes-cost-more.html">recently told the New York Times</a>, “There’s more things in the path of these hurricanes than there’s ever been.” 
<br><br>
        Florida has been hit with a not so perfect storm of problems with consequences that will continue to compound each other. As climate change increases the risk of severe hurricanes, the housing crisis will become harder and harder to address. With a worsening housing market, recovery and adaptation will be nearly impossible for Florida’s economy to handle. 
<br><br>
There are avenues the state could explore to mitigate the situation. This could be adapting building structures and seawalls to attempt to withstand the weather events and sea level rise. Or perhaps encouraging coastal residents to relocate. Unfortunately, there is no immediate or perfect solution. This should be a call to action for governments, corporations, and residents to rebuild their communities and find ways to prevent future catastrophes.
